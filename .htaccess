# Apache commands are stored in this file. This file loads the RewriteEngine, which is used 
# redirect all HTTP requests, except those to /static/ folders and those that are PHP files 
# itself, to Index Gateway stored in /index.php. These commands and Wave Framework itself 
# only work when RewriteEngine is supported on the web server.
