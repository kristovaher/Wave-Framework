		<h1>Factory Class</h1>
		
			<h2>Files</h2>
			
				<h3>/engine/class.www-factory.php</h3>
		
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			
				<p>Factory class is the base class for a lot of Wave Framework dynamically loaded model, view and controller objects. It is not required to build your <a href="guide_mvc.htm">MVC</a> objects by extending Factory class, but doing so can make the development of these objects easier, as Factory also has wrappers to <a href="guide_state.htm">State</a>, Wave Framework <a href="guide_api.htm">API</a> and other functionality.</p>
				
				<p>Factory class includes methods that dynamically load <a href="guide_mvc.htm">MVC</a> objects as well as other classes that have been defined in the system. This includes internal Wave Framework classes such as <a href="imager.htm">Imager</a>, <a href="minifier.htm">Minifier</a> and <a href="database.htm">Database</a> classes.</p>
				
				<p>A lot of the methods defined in Factory class are wrappers. These wrapper methods are documented further in their own class-specific documentation files and are listed in this documentation here only for reference.</p>
				
			<h2>Using Factory class</h2>
			
				<p>Factory class is an internal Wave Framework class and should not be used outside the context of Wave Framework.</p>
				
			<h2>Factory Class Parameters</h2>
			
				<h3>private $WWW_API=false</h3>
				
					<p>This variable holds the API object that is currently used by Wave Framework and Factory. API object is the core engine of Wave Framework.</p>
					
				<h3>private $WWW_API_callIndex=0</h3>
				
					<p>This is an internal variable that holds a counter of how many times the API has been called.  It is possible to call <a href="guide_api.htm">API</a> calls within other <a href="guide_api.htm">API</a> calls, so this is used to keep track of how deep the current <a href="guide_api.htm">API</a> call is, which is used to calculate buffering layers and other internal functionality in <a href="api.htm">API</a> Class.
					
			<h2>Factory Class Methods</h2>
			
				<h3>final public function __construct($api=false,$callIndex=0)</h3>
				
					<p>Construction method of Factory class initializes currently used API and <a href="guide_api.htm">API</a> call index settings within the new object that is extended from Factory. This method will also call __initialize() method, if such a method is set in the class that is extended from Factory, as it is not allowed to overwrite __construct class itself.</p>
			
				<h3>final protected function api($command,$inputData=array(),$useBuffer=true)</h3>
				
					<p>This method is used by objects, that have been extended from Factory class, to make new <a href="guide_api.htm">API</a> calls to Wave Framework. It takes a 'www-command' value in $command variable and an array of key and value pairs in $inputData variable that is used as input data. If $useBuffer is set to true, then API is told that it can use an internal <a href="guide_api.htm">API</a> buffer call, which means that if API has already gotten the same exact <a href="guide_api.htm">API</a> call with the same exact input variables, then it returns the result from buffer directly rather than execute it again.</p>
			
				<h3>final protected function apiConnection($address)</h3>
				
					<p>This method is used to initialize PHP API Wrapper object. This object can be used to send <a href="guide_api.htm">API</a> calls to other API systems, that have been built on Wave Framework, over HTTP. $address is the API address URL that Wave Framework connects with. This method returns a new API Wrapper object.</p>
					
				<h3>final protected function getModel($model,$methodName=false,$methodData=array())</h3>
				
					<p>This is one of the core methods of Factory class. This method is used to return a new Wave Framework model. Model name is $model and it should exist as a file in /models/ or /overrides/models/ subfolder as model.[$model].php file. If $methodName is set, then this method will also automatically call that method and return result of that method instead of the model object itself. If $methodData is also set, then this is the input variable sent to $methodName.</p>
					
				<h3>final protected function getController($controller,$methodName=false,$methodData=array())</h3>
				
					<p>This is one of the core methods of Factory class. This method is used to return a new Wave Framework controller. Controller name is $controller and it should exist as a file in /models/ or /overrides/models/ subfolder as controller.[$controller].php file. If $methodName is set, then this method will also automatically call that method and return result of that method instead of the controller object itself. If $methodData is also set, then this is the input variable sent to $methodName.</p>
					
				<h3>final protected function getView($view,$methodName=false,$methodData=array())</h3>
				
					<p>This is one of the core methods of Factory class. This method is used to return a new Wave Framework view. View name is $view and it should exist as a file in /models/ or /overrides/models/ subfolder as view.[$view].php file. If $methodName is set, then this method will also automatically call that method and return result of that method instead of the view object itself. If $methodData is also set, then this is the input variable sent to $methodName.</p>
			
				<h3>final protected function getObject($className,$methodName=false,$methodData=array())</h3>
				
					<p>This method loads and returns a new object for a class $className. Factory attempts to load this class definition from a file in /resources/classes/ or /overrides/resources/classes/ folder and file name should be written in format class.[$className].php in that folder. If $methodName is set, then this method will also automatically call that method and return result of that method instead of the view object itself. If $methodData is also set, then this is the input variable sent to $methodName.</p>
			
				<h3>final protected function getImager($source=false)</h3>
				
					<p>This method loads <a href="imager.htm">Imager</a> class that is used for image editing. If $source is set, then it also automatically assigns a source image file for that <a href="imager.htm">Imager</a>.</p>
			
				<h3>final protected function applyImager($source,$command,$target=false)</h3>
				
					<p>This is a wrapper method for <a href="imager.htm">Imager</a> class method commands(). This method allows to load a file, edit a file and store a file in <a href="filesystem.htm">Filesystem</a> in just a single method call. $source should be the image file in <a href="filesystem.htm">Filesystem</a>, $command is the Wave Framework styled <a href="handler_image.htm">Image Handler</a> accepted parameter string, like '320x240&amp;filter(grayscale)' and $target should be the destination address for the file. If $target is missing then result is pushed to output buffer.</p>
			
				<h3>final protected function applyMinifier($data,$type)</h3>
				
					<p>This method is used to apply static Minifier class method to a text string. $data should be the data string to be modified and $type should be the format type (either xml, html, js or css). This method returns modified string that is minified by Minifier class.</p>
					
				<h3>final protected function resultError($message='Error',$customData=false,$responseCode=300)</h3>
				
					<p>Wave Framework <a href="guide_mvc.htm">MVC</a> object method calls can return their data in whatever format developer finds necessary, but it is recommended to return data in a standardized form. This method returns an array in the format of an error. $message should be the verbose message returned, $customData should be an array of data returned as part of the result and $responseCode should be an response code in 3XX namespace, which is used for errors in Wave Framework.</p>
			
				<h3>final protected function resultFalse($message='OK',$customData=false,$responseCode=400)</h3>
				
					<p>Wave Framework <a href="guide_mvc.htm">MVC</a> object method calls can return their data in whatever format developer finds necessary, but it is recommended to return data in a standardized form. This method returns an array in the format of a false result, which should be used when an action failed but is not considered an error. $message should be the verbose message returned, $customData should be an array of data returned as part of the result and $responseCode should be a response code in 4XX namespace, which is used for false results in Wave Framework.</p>
			
				<h3>final protected function resultTrue($message='OK',$customData=false,$responseCode=500)</h3>
				
					<p>Wave Framework <a href="guide_mvc.htm">MVC</a> object method calls can return their data in whatever format developer finds necessary, but it is recommended to return data in a standardized form. This method returns an array in the format of a successful result. $message should be the verbose message returned, $customData should be an array of data returned as part of the result and $responseCode should be an response code in 5XX namespace, which is used for successful results in Wave Framework.</p>
			
				<h3>final protected function checkTrueFalse($data)</h3>
				
					<p>This method is used to check for standardized <a href="guide_api.htm">API</a> call result and determine if the <a href="guide_api.htm">API</a> call was successful or not. It essentially checks for response codes in the array. $data is the result data array that is checked.</p>
			
				<h3>final protected function checkError($data)</h3>
				
					<p>This method is used to check for standardized <a href="guide_api.htm">API</a> call result and determine if the <a href="guide_api.htm">API</a> call had an error. It essentially checks for response codes in the array. $data is the result data array that is checked.</p>
					
				<h3>final protected function disableCache($state=true)</h3>
				
					<p>This method will tell Wave Framework API not to cache current <a href="guide_api.htm">API</a> call, no matter what. This means that while current <a href="guide_api.htm">API</a> call may be loaded from cache, but in case the cache does not exist the result will not be written to cache.</p>
					
				<h3>final protected function getReturnType()</h3>
				
					<p>This returns the www-return-type of currently known <a href="guide_api.htm">API</a> request. This can be used to modify the request response based on what data is requested, if this is needed.</p>
					
				<h3>final protected function dbNew($type,$host,$database,$username,$password,$showErrors=false,$persistentConnection=false)</h3>
				
					<p>This method can be used to dynamically create a new database connection object from <a href="database.htm">Database</a> class. $type is the database type, $host, $database, $username, $password are database connection credentials. And $showErrors defines whether errors should be thrown if encountered and $persistentConnection sets whether connection should be reused, if such already exists.</p>
					
				<h3>final protected function dbPDO()</h3>
				
					<p>This method returns the PDO class that API is currently using, if one is active.</p>
			
			<h2>Factory Class Wrapper Methods for State Class</h2>
			
				<p>Descriptions of these methods are detailed in <a href="state.htm">State</a> Class documentation.</p>

				<h3>final protected function getSitemapRaw($language=false,$keyword=false)</h3>
				
				<h3>final protected function stateMessenger($address,$overwrite=false)</h3>
			
				<h3>final protected function setMessengerData($key,$value=false)</h3>
				
					<p>This method stores data $value under key of $key. It also turns off caching of the current <a href="guide_api.htm">API</a> call as a result, since <a href="guide_messenger.htm">State Messenger</a> Class is outside the scope of caching.</p>
			
				<h3>final protected function unsetMessengerData($key=false)</h3>
			
				<h3>final protected function getMessengerData($address=false,$remove=true)</h3>
				
					<p>This method returns data from <a href="guide_messenger.htm">State Messenger</a> Class with an address of $address. If $remove is set - as it is by default - then <a href="guide_messenger.htm">State Messenger</a> Class of this $address is also deleted and cannot be accessed again.</p>
