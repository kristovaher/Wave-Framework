		<h1>Making Terminal Calls</h1>
		
			<p>This documentation covers functionality of objects that use a class that is extended from WWW_Factory class. Methods and calls in this documentation can be used when building your Models, Views and Controller classes and their functionality.</p>
		
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			
				<p>PHP has multiple methods for making terminal requests, depending on the server. To simplify this process, Wave Framework has a wrapper function that tries to find the most suitable function to use when making terminal calls. This terminal method is a wrapper to system(), passthru(), exec() and shell_exec() functions.</p>
				
			<h2>Making Terminal Calls</h2>
			
				<p>To make a terminal call in an object that is extended from WWW_Factory class, you have to call terminal() method with a variable that is the command to be sent to terminal, like this:</p>
				
<pre>
	<code>
	// Making terminal call
	$result=$this->terminal('ls');
	// Printing out the result
	echo $result;
	</code>
</pre>

				<p>Please note that on a lot of servers - especially on shared hosting servers - the terminal calls are disabled entirely.</p>
