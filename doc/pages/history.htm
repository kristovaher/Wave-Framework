		<h1>Version History</h1>
		
			<h2>Roadmap</h2>
			
				<ul>
					<li><b>Q4 2012</b> - Additional tutorials about AJAX and User Sessions</li>
					<li><b>Q4 2012</b> - Testing suite for Wave Framework that can be used to test Wave Framework with mock Models and actual Controllers.</li>
					<li><b>Q4 2012</b> - OpenSSL public and private-key based two-way API security for API profiles. OpenSSL based helper functions for creating hashes and validating hashes with a certificate key. OpenSSL based developer tool for generating cryptography public and private keys.</li>
				</ul>
		
			<h2>3.x.x</h2>
			
				<ul>
					<li><b>3.1.0</b> - Much-improved session handling for situations where session data is rapidly modified and set or unset with different session ID values.</li>
					<li><b>3.0.9</b> - PHP and JavaScript wrappers now also accept anonymous functions as callbacks. Callback keywords have also been renamed to 'www-true-callback', 'www-false-callback' to be similar to standardized error arrays returned from Controllers. Also added a jQuery fallback for parsing JSON in older versions of Internet Explorer.</li>
					<li><b>3.0.8</b> - It is now possible to set the lifetime of session cookie with startSession() method, with the lifetime as the first parameter. Also added improved session handling that now regenerates session keys based on new 'session-lifetime' configuration setting. Also added session fingerprinting to prevent some forms of session hijacking.</li>
					<li><b>3.0.7</b> - Fixed a bug where cached result of URL Controller could have failed to change the State data about current View.</li>
					<li><b>3.0.6</b> - Added an option that allows dynamic URL rules to also accept 'infinite' number value or string length.</li>
					<li><b>3.0.5</b> - Added setHeader() and unsetHeader() wrapper methods for Factory as well as updated the tutorial to use one of these methods.</li>
					<li><b>3.0.4</b> - Includes a new dynamic URL matching in Sitemap that allows URL nodes to be matched against a fixed list, or checked for being numeric, letters or alphanumeric. This allows Wave Framework to carry the burden of validating dynamic URL, leaving the developer to just use the matched URL for whatever is needed.</li>
					<li><b>3.0.1</b> - Slight optimizations and code cleaning as well as expanded FAQ section of documentation.</li>
					<li><b>3.0.0</b> - Complete overhaul of documentation, Wave Framework now comes with an ~100 page documentation. Documentation files are also included in framework archive under /docs/ subfolder and they also include examples by default. This makes it easier to get all the required information from one place, as well as keep track of documentation changes independently from website or repository. Also includes multiple bug-fixes and code refactoring and minor new features. Entire framework has also passed through integrity testing of each of its features to detect logic flaws and other minor bugs.</li>
				</ul>
		
			<h2>2.x.x</h2>
		
				<ul>
					<li><b>2.6.3</b> - It's also possible to send set of commands with file upload by naming them www-xml or www-json. This is an alternative to sending the entire set of commands with input stream.</li>
					<li><b>2.6.2</b> - Added an option to send XML or JSON string as direct input stream in POST. Added XML support check to compatibility script. dbQuote and dbDebug tweaks to offer better functionality. </li>
					<li><b>2.6.1</b> - Tweaks to cache tagging. Ability to tag caches created through Data Handler (sitemap-specific pages).</li>
					<li><b>2.6.0</b> - APC is now used for storing cache, if APC is enabled on the server. Additional MVC Factory methods have been added for that purpose. Custom caching methods added. Encryption/decryption wrappers have also been added to Factory inherited objects.</li>
					<li><b>2.5.8</b> - Additional security checks for IP's and configuration for trusted proxies. Additional database related methods and better error handling. Slight tweaks to configuration loading.</li>
					<li><b>2.5.6</b> - Now named Wave Framework! Also added option to fetch previous cache results for current API call. Bug fix that stopped proper redirects happen, if API response assigned for a redirect.</li>
					<li><b>2.5.5</b> - It's now possible to log requests based on regular expression being matched against the request URL and ignore other requests. Also fixed a bug related to database connection query counter logging.</li>
					<li><b>2.5.4</b> - Better defaults handling for URL Controller. Added ability to store multiple views - based on methods - in a single View class. API handles View and other echo/print specific output much better and standardizes it with the rest of the API, by returning arrays.</li>
					<li><b>2.5.2</b> - It is now possible to use cookies with PHP API Wrappers, in case an API is designed that is authorized with cookies and sessions as opposed to more secure methods. While it is not recommended to use API in this manner, the option is there. Fixed bug when returning the last ID from database. Fixed the bug when State messenger data is unset entirely.</li>
					<li><b>2.5.1</b> - Added initial implementation of cache tagging and API observers. API rights are now called 'permissions' instead in both profiles and sitemap configuration. Added image format conversion options. Renamed functions.php file to autoload.php, since it can carry additional functionality. Added dynamic class loader to Factory.</li>
					<li><b>2.4.7</b> - Added better default rights example to URL controller. Fixed Internet Explorer specific bug with base tag in View controller. Added 'float' to database dbQuote method. Added 'base-url' to State.</li>
					<li><b>2.4.6</b> - Added internal split time method for debugging execution time. If PHP is used as a content type and an error is found during API execution with response code of 1XX or 2XX, then this results in PHP warning being thrown and logged for Debugger script. Updated database query error logging.</li>
					<li><b>2.4.5</b> - Fixed undefined error bug for non-HTML API results, fixed last modified check in File Handler.</li>
					<li><b>2.4.4</b> - Added /resources/static/ subfolder - Files from this folder will never be served through PHP. This can be used for specific static files that might be faster when served without PHP. Unified some isset() calls. Fixed a potential bug with system root folder. Fixed some compatibility tests.</li>
					<li><b>2.4.3</b> - Sessions are unset, if session array is found to be empty. It also removes session cookie, if that happens. Improved performance by unifying a handful unset() method calls.</li>
					<li><b>2.4.2</b> - Fixed cache related bug with state messenger (state messenger now turns cache off, when used). Added Factory method to disable cache on-demand. Fixed typo in cookie name.</li>
					<li><b>2.4.1</b> - Database only connects now when actually used. Additional parameters defined for returned view data. Better Range header handling. Better limiter responses and correct header for too-many-requests IP block. Fix for sporadic DEPRECATED error reporting. Tools now use proper configuration timezone.</li>
					<li><b>2.4.0</b> - Added some defaults to be returned to view when using URL controller. Updated INI generation algorithm.</li>
					<li><b>2.3.9</b> - Added author and copyright settings to configuration. Streamlined database class method names and made it possible to create a new instance of a database through Factory. Added an option to have a cut-off timestamp when cleaning files from filesystem.</li>

Error reporting settings have been removed from configuration. Using JSON now for log messages and internal logging due to better handling of new-line symbols. Also removed quirks regarding array being passed by reference.</li>
					<li><b>2.3.6</b> - Much improved error-handling, now catches and logs even PHP-specific error messages. Added options to have array support for many State specific functions, like getting a translation keyword or specific detail about a user session. Added internal error logging in case an error is thrown in code. Streamlined view-data in State to simply be 'view'. Updated log files to be written with *.log extension instead of *.tmp extension.</li>
					<li><b>2.3.5</b> - Added user session management wrappers.</li>
					<li><b>2.3.4</b> - Added option to limit logging to specific IP's only. Updated view data to be merged with unsolved URL array. Added whitelist limiter to allow access to only specific IP's.</li>
					<li><b>2.3.3</b> - Fixed a potential loophole in cache when serving static images and resources.</li>
					<li><b>2.3.2</b> - Optimized URL controller functionality. Fixed a bug in view controller that was introduced in previous update. Using PHP's serialization instead of JSON for internal caches and data storage due to speed benefits. Updated log reader with some power-user functionality.</li>
					<li><b>2.3.0</b> - Refactoring of configuration, translation and API profile files to use INI files instead of PHP files. Added methods to load translations and sitemap information from API directly.</li>
					<li><b>2.2.7</b> - Added session rights management. Added session rights key. Updated bootstrap rights check algorithm. Streamlined view controller.</li>
					<li><b>2.2.6</b> - Refactored MVC class naming. The prefixes are now {model/view/controller}.{*}.php instead of class.{*}.php. This makes the file navigation clearer when browsing files based on filename.</li>
					<li><b>2.2.5</b> - Added styles to developer tools.</li>
					<li><b>2.2.4</b> - Updated API information tool to display all type of comments, not just Docblock comments. Made sure that API checks for private and protected methods, which it cannot call. Applied protected visibility to Factory class methods to eliminate the possibility of calling these methods through API. Added an option to generate documentation for only specific API profiles.</li>
					<li><b>2.2.1</b> - Added API information tool that automatically generates full API documentation. Added configuration option for database errors. Updated URL controller redirection logic. Improved API command security by providing controller command blacklist as well as making it a requirement to define allowed API commands in API profile configuration.

					<li><b>2.0.7</b> - Wrapper refactoring and browser compatibility issues fixed. Better request validations.</li>
					<li><b>2.0.6</b> - Added session and cookie namespaces. Removed session-specific configuration options from configuration file, since sessions are now loaded only if they are actually used. Fixed bug with database error reporting. Improved API Wrappers to keep API authentication details by default as well as detect token if it was sent as a response to www-create-session command.</li>
					<li><b>2.0.4</b> - Nginx configuration adjustments and state detection for Nginx specific system paths. Compatibility script now properly detects Nginx server and settings.</li>
					<li><b>2.0.3</b> - Slight adjustments to API and token validations. Updated wrappers with error codes.</li>
