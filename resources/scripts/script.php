 * MyProjectNameHere <http://www.example.com>
 * PHP Autoload Script
 *
 * By default, this file is empty as no libraries are used or loaded by Wave Framework. But 
 * if you wish to add system-wide functions, then this file can be used for that purpose as 
 * it is loaded by Index Gateway for all requests that are served by Data Handler and API 
 * Handler. Generally it is useful to not have a general library in a system, as it can make 
 * testing more difficult, but it can be useful at times. It is also possible to add other 
 * functionality to this file that is not necessarily a function definition. This will make 
 * sure that the Index Gateway and Handlers themselves are not touched during project 
 * development for the same purpose.

  * You can access some of the core variables and defined objects here. This includes State 
  * object from $state variable, that includes all configuration and some session/cookie 
  * related functionality. You can also use $databaseConnection object, which is defined if 
  * database settings are set in Configuration. Thus you can make database requests in this 
  * Autoload script. It is recommended that you read more in Autoload documentation.
